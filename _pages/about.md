This blog was created using [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie). It is a Jekyll theme forked from [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) with some additional features.This is a plug-and-play Jekyll theme which you can use on GitHub Pages without even setting up a local environment.
