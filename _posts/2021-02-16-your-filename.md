SimpleITK (SITK) is a simplified programming interface to the algorithms and data structures of the Insight Toolkit (ITK). This means its a library that helps you load images and perform transformations (which are mentioned in the ITK) on them. 

Images in SITK are different from those we are used to seeing everyday. Each pixel or [voxel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel) \[3D pixel basically\] is not isotropically spaced. That means, 

1. Images can have different spacing between pixels along each axis
2. The axes are not necessarily orthogonal.



This is a libra
  - Load an image (single image)
  - Image attributes
    - Spacing
    - Direction corsines
    - other small attributes (size etc)
  - Transforms
    - Translation
    - Affine types
