## What is a traumatic brain injury?

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a form of acquired brain injury. It occurs when a sudden trauma causes damage to the brain. TBI can result when the head suddenly and violently hits an object, or when an object pierces the skull and enters brain tissue [1](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Traumatic-Brain-Injury-Information-Page). Typically a result of road accidents, sports injuries or assaults. The impact that causes the head to jerk suddenly causes a **primary injury**. Symptoms of this can include confusion, dizziness or loss of consciousness completely. This is not the end of the story however. Due to effects of the impact, certain **secondary injuries** can appear. eg. A traumatic injury to the head may cause brain to shift to one side, causing blockage in an artery, which can cause brain cells to slowly die due to **hypoxia** (lack of oxygen) in that region. 

Depending on the effect of the injury, it can be a **focal** if it is localised in only one area of the brain or **diffused**, if its more spread out all over the brain. According to the severity of injury, TBIs are classified as:

  1. **Mild**: person is awake; eyes open. Symptoms can include confusion, disorientation, memory loss, headache, and brief loss of consciousness.
  2. **Moderate**: person is lethargic; eyes open to stimulation. Loss of consciousness lasting 20 minutes to 6 hours. Some brain swelling or bleeding causing sleepiness, but still arousable.
  3. **Severe**: person is unconscious; eyes do not open, even with stimulation. Loss of consciousness lasting more than 6 hours.

**Glasgow coma scale**

When the head is injured, the immidiate effect felt due to the mechanism of injury is called the **Primary injury**. These can be the following:

  1. **Concussion**: A mild injury to the brain. These can occur when the brain shifts rapidly and comes in contact with the skull but no profuse bleeding occurs. Can cause loss of consciousness. Typically heals without any permanent damage.
  
  2. **Contusion**: This is bruising of brain tissue. When examined under a microscope, cerebral contusions are comparable to bruises in other parts of the body. They consist of areas of injured or swollen brain mixed with blood that has leaked from arteries, veins, or capillaries.
  
  3. **Hematomas**: These are blood clots within the brain (called **Intracerebral**), between the brain and its dura (lining) (called **epidural**) or between its dura and the skull (called **epidural**). These clots form due to some form of arterial bleeding. While small clots can be re-absorbed by the brain [2](https://mayfieldclinic.com/pe-tbi.htm), large ones apply pressure inside the brain and need to be surgically removed.
  
  4. **Haemorrhages**: These represent more active bleeding scenarios where the blood does not clot that easily, usually due to the rupturing of an artery as opposed to a capillary or vein in hematomas. These can be either inside the brain tissue (**Intracerebral**) or inside the subarachnoid space (**Subarachnoid**) which is the space between the innermost lining of the brain (pia mater) and middle lining of the brain (arachnoid mater).
  
  5. **Diffuse injury**: Injuries that produce microscopic changes that do not appear on CT scans and are scattered throughout the brain. A special type of this injury is called the **Diffuse axonal injury (DAI)**, which occurs due to shearing and stretching of the nerve cells at the cellular level. Axons are a part of the nerve cell which help in communication between cells. DAI can impair this ability to communicate between cells and severely impair the patient.
  
Continuation of damage to the brain as a result of physiological effecits of primary injury is called the **secondary injury**. This can take from hours to days to occur. Most of the focus during the treatment of a TBI is to control the secondary injuries by balancing a variety of variables such as pressure, oxygen supply to the brain, preventing blockages, etc. [3](https://www.aans.org/Patients/Neurosurgical-Conditions-and-Treatments/Traumatic-Brain-Injury). The factors that affect secondary injury are mainly:

1. **Cerebral Profusion Pressure (CPP)**: This is the difference in pressure of the artery (**Mean arterial pressure (MAP)**) and the pressure already exisiting in the brain (**Intracranial pressure (ICP)**). The CPP dictates the amount of blood that goes into the brain, also called **Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF)**. Now, the brain has a fixed amount of space. This includes 80% of brain tissue, 10% of blood and 10% of CSF (stated in the famous **Monro-Kellie doctrine**). During a bleed, blood inside the skull can increase, and since the volumne is fixed, pressure inside it increases as well. The body does have regulatory methods to handle this by draining CSF elsewhere, but this can only work to some extent. After that, the ICP starts rapidly increasing, which can cause other parts of the brain to get crushed or damaged. Another effect of ICP increasing is lower CPP and therefore lower CBF. And with lower bloodflow, cells can start dying after sometime. Here is a graph that explains this effect:

<p style="text-align:center"><i> Graph showing the amount of time before cell death begins due to Ischemia (shortage of oxygen). You can see that if the brain gets a CBF of about 18 mL/100g/min for 4 hours, Infarction (or cell death) can begin. With decrease in CBF, this cell death becomes even faster.
