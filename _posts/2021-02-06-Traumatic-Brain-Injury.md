## What is a traumatic brain injury?

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a form of acquired brain injury. It occurs when a sudden trauma causes damage to the brain. TBI can result when the head suddenly and violently hits an object, or when an object pierces the skull and enters brain tissue [1](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Traumatic-Brain-Injury-Information-Page). Typically a result of road accidents, sports injuries or assaults. The impact that causes the head to jerk suddenly causes a **primary injury**. Symptoms of this can include confusion, dizziness or loss of consciousness completely. This is not the end of the story however. Due to effects of the impact, certain **secondary injuries** can appear. eg. A traumatic injury to the head may cause brain to shift to one side, causing blockage in an artery, which can cause brain cells to slowly die due to **hypoxia** (lack of oxygen) in that region. 

Depending on the effect of the injury, it can be a **focal** if it is localised in only one area of the brain or **diffused**, if its more spread out all over the brain. According to the severity of injury, TBIs are classified as:

  1. **Mild**: person is awake; eyes open. Symptoms can include confusion, disorientation, memory loss, headache, and brief loss of consciousness.
  2. **Moderate**: person is lethargic; eyes open to stimulation. Loss of consciousness lasting 20 minutes to 6 hours. Some brain swelling or bleeding causing sleepiness, but still arousable.
  3. **Severe**: person is unconscious; eyes do not open, even with stimulation. Loss of consciousness lasting more than 6 hours.

**Glasgow coma scale**

When the head is injured, the immidiate effect felt due to the mechanism of injury is called the **Primary injury**. These can be the following:

  1. **Concussion**: A mild injury to the brain. These can occur when the brain shifts rapidly and comes in contact with the skull but no profuse bleeding occurs. Can cause loss of consciousness. Typically heals without any permanent damage.
  
  2. **Contusion**: This is bruising of brain tissue. When examined under a microscope, cerebral contusions are comparable to bruises in other parts of the body. They consist of areas of injured or swollen brain mixed with blood that has leaked from arteries, veins, or capillaries.
  
  3. **Hematomas**: These are blood clots within the brain (called **Intracerebral**), between the brain and its dura (lining) (called **epidural**) or between its dura and the skull (called **epidural**). These clots form due to some form of arterial bleeding. While small clots can be re-absorbed by the brain [2](https://mayfieldclinic.com/pe-tbi.htm), large ones apply pressure inside the brain and need to be surgically removed.
  
  4. **Haemorrhages**: These represent more active bleeding scenarios where the blood does not clot that easily, usually due to the rupturing of an artery as opposed to a capillary or vein in hematomas. These can be either inside the brain tissue (**Intracerebral**) or inside the subarachnoid space (**Subarachnoid**) which is the space between the innermost lining of the brain (pia mater) and middle lining of the brain (arachnoid mater).
  
  5. **Diffuse injury**: Injuries that produce microscopic changes that do not appear on CT scans and are scattered throughout the brain. A special type of this injury is called the **Diffuse axonal injury (DAI)**, which occurs due to shearing and stretching of the nerve cells at the cellular level. Axons are a part of the nerve cell which help in communication between cells. DAI can impair this ability to communicate between cells and severely impair the patient.
  
Continuation of damage to the brain as a result of physiological effecits of primary injury. These include: Hypoximia, Hypotension, Anemia, increased Intra-cranial pressure, Impaired autoregulation. Hypo/Hypercapina, Hypo/Hyperglycemia, Biochemical changes and metabolic demand.
