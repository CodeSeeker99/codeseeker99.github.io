## What is a traumatic brain injury?

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a form of acquired brain injury. It occurs when a sudden trauma causes damage to the brain. TBI can result when the head suddenly and violently hits an object, or when an object pierces the skull and enters brain tissue [1](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Traumatic-Brain-Injury-Information-Page). Typically a result of road accidents, sports injuries or assaults. The impact that causes the head to jerk suddenly causes a **primary injury**. Symptoms of this can include confusion, dizziness or loss of consciousness completely. This is not the end of the story however. Due to effects of the impact, certain **secondary injuries** can appear. eg. A traumatic injury to the head may cause brain to shift to one side, causing blockage in an artery, which can cause brain cells to slowly die due to **hypoxia** (lack of oxygen) in that region.
