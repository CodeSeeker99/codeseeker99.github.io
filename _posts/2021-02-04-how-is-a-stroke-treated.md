_A quick guide to clinical pathways that go into diagnosing and treating a stroke_

## What is a stroke?

A stroke is a type of medical emergency that occurs when blood supply to the brain gets interrupted due to some reason. Worldwide, it is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability [1](https://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/en/). The property that makes strokes so deadly is the amount of time the patient has, to get treatment before the problem advances to a serious stage. Since cells in the brain require a constant supply of blood, even the smallest of delays can lead to death of brain cells, most of which can not be regenerated. Typically, patients have a great chance of full recovery if they get treatment hours of the first symptoms. Even in the best scenarios, there can be some irreversible damage to the brain.

Strokes or cerebrovascular accidents are primarily due to either of 2 reasons; **Ischemia** or **Haemorrhage**. 

<h3 style="text-align:left">Ischemic</h3>
Ischemic strokes are caused when a blood vessel gets blocked off due to some kind of obstruction in it. This is usually due to plaque buildup in the blood, or a clot in the bloodstream. **Transient Ischemic Attacks (ministrokes)** is a type of stroke that happens due to Ischemia in the brain arteries but they usually clear up on their own after sometime, hence lasting for a short period of time. 

<h3 style="text-align:left">Haemorrhagic</h3>
Haemorrhagic strokes happen when a blood artery ruptures and begins leaking blood inside the brain. As a result, blood does not reach where it was supposed to, and some parts of the brain are deprived of Oxygen and nutrients. These strokes are usually more deadly as compares to Ischemic strokes as the increasing blood volume inside the brain applies pressure to the rest of the brain and results in more damage. 

### How does one recognise a stroke?

To recognise stroke symptoms, the general hueristic is to look at the **Face**, **Arms**, and **Speech** of a person. An easy way to remember this is to remember the acronym **FAST**. 
  - **Face**:   If the patient's face is drooping on any side
  - **Arms**:   If any one arm is more difficult to move than the other.
  - **Speech**: If there is slurred speech
  - **Time**:   If any of the above are true, its time to call the ambulance as these are signs of a stroke.

The symptoms on mentioned above happen when the part of the brain controlling them starts becoming deprived of oxygen.
