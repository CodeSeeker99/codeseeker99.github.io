_A quick guide to clinical pathways that go into diagnosing and treating a stroke_

## What is a stroke?

A stroke is a type of medical emergency that occurs when blood supply to the brain gets interrupted due to some reason. Worldwide, it is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability [[1](https://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/en/)]. The property that makes strokes so deadly is the amount of time the patient has, to get treatment before the problem advances to a serious stage. Since cells in the brain require a constant supply of blood, even the smallest of delays can lead to death of brain cells, most of which can not be regenerated. Typically, patients have a great chance of full recovery if they get treatment hours of the first symptoms. Even in the best scenarios, there can be some irreversible damage to the brain.

Strokes or cerebrovascular accidents are primarily due to either of 2 reasons; **Ischemia** or **Haemorrhage**. 

<h3 style="text-align:left">Ischemic</h3>
Ischemic strokes are caused when a blood vessel gets blocked off due to some kind of obstruction in it. This is usually due to plaque buildup in the blood, or a clot in the bloodstream. **Transient Ischemic Attacks (ministrokes)** is a type of stroke that happens due to Ischemia in the brain arteries but they usually clear up on their own after sometime, hence lasting for a short period of time. 

<h3 style="text-align:left">Haemorrhagic</h3>
Haemorrhagic strokes happen when a blood artery ruptures and begins leaking blood inside the brain. As a result, blood does not reach where it was supposed to, and some parts of the brain are deprived of Oxygen and nutrients. These strokes are usually more deadly as compares to Ischemic strokes as the increasing blood volume inside the brain applies pressure to the rest of the brain and results in more damage. 

### How does one recognise a stroke?

To recognise stroke symptoms, the general hueristic is to look at the **Face**, **Arms**, and **Speech** of a person. An easy way to remember this is to remember the acronym **FAST**. 
  - **Face**:   If the patient's face is drooping on any side
  - **Arms**:   If any one arm is more difficult to move than the other.
  - **Speech**: If there is slurred speech
  - **Time**:   If any of the above are true, its time to call the ambulance as these are signs of a stroke.

The symptoms on mentioned above happen when the part of the brain controlling them starts becoming deprived of oxygen.


## Diagnosis

<h3 style="text-align:left">From symptom detection to the hospital ER</h3>

Once the symptoms are detected, the patient is rushed to the hospital. The patient is taken to an emergency room and rushed for imaging after drawing blood [[2](https://youtu.be/n1qL12UGJt0?t=658)]. If the patient is conscious and the symptoms are mild, then physical examination is done by a neurologist to better determine where to look for the bleed in imaging [[3](https://youtu.be/yTMZsxSBv_0?t=145)]. Other risk factors such as existing conditions are also considered. These include but are not limited to Hypertension, Cholestrol, smoking habits, and heart conditions. Basically, any condition that may affect the blood pressure (as high blood pressure is often the cause of haemorrhages).

Blood tests are also done parallely to determine if the cause of weakness/unconsciousness is due to low haemoglobin [[4](https://evtoday.com/articles/2019-feb/stroke-patient-workflow-optimization)]. The **Complete Blood Count (CBC)** is used to check for blood conditions. These may also help determine the Etiology of the stroke (i.e cause of the stroke). For example, if the platelet count is low, then there is a higher chance of it being a haemorrhagic stroke. **Electrolytes** and **Blood Sugar** imbalance may also cause stroke-like symptoms. For eg. a low amount of Sodium in blood, can cause impaired electrical activity in the brain, which gives the same symptoms as a stroke. Similarly, Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar can also cause stroke-like symptoms. There are certain **proteins** in the blood that can cause excessive coalgulation, this is checked for as well. Finally, a toxicology report is also created to check for substances which mimic stroke symptoms [[5](https://youtu.be/AgPpM4jqkxU)].

<h3 style="text-align:left">Imaging</h3>

Imaging is one of the important confirmation tests done when a stroke is suspected. This is where the etiology of the stroke is determined. Primarily, there are 3 ways in which the brain can be imaged. The fastest method is a simple head CT scan as shown below. While the resolution of this image is less, haemorrhagic strokes can be easily identified in this scan as blood is visible as bright white (since it is denser than the sorrounding tissue) on this scan. Any area that should not have blood, but is showing up white on the scan can immiditely be identified as an area of haemorrhage. Ischemic strokes are not that easy to identy with just a simple CT scan as the areas deprived of blood can seem just as dense as the other regions for quite a long time. After some time however, the deprived region starts to appear darker in the CT scan as the cells keep dying. 

**CT IMAGE**

For ischemic stroke detection, a CT angiogram is created to picture the blood vessels in the brain. This is basically a normal CT scan, but the patient is injected with a fluid that lights up in their bloodstream on the CT images. These images are then cleared off of any tissue, and only the vessels are highlighted. This can show if any artery has a sudden breaking off point, which may indicated bloackage.

**CT Angiogram**

Finally, an MRI scan shows tissues of the brain in very high resolution. While this scan takes quite a bit of time, it provides a very high quality image, from which blood circulation can be judged easily. Both CT scans are recommended to be performed if the patient is present in the ER within 6 hours of symptoms [[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6707502/)]

## Treatment

<h3 style="text-align:left">Ischemic</h3>

**Thrombolytics**: These are a drugs that are targeted to destroy blood clots (thrombus) in the blood stream. For Ischemic strokes these are often the first choice of treatment. However these are only effective if administered quickly after symptoms present themselves. A window of 4.5 hours is defined by the National Institutes of Health, USA [[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6707502/)]. The most commonly administered thrombolytic is called **Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA)** [[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507917/)]. Aspirin generally follows thrombolytic therapy, as it is an anticoagulant, and helps in keeping the blood from clotting again.

Here, you can appreciate why knowing the etiology of the stroke is very important. If an anticoagulant or thrombolytic is administered in a haemorrhagic stroke case, that will make the situation much worse as the ruptured artery would not be able to stop bleeding through clotting!

**Endovascular treatment**: In cases where the clot or blockage has become too big for drugs to work effectively, mechanical operation is performed to remove the clot from the blood vessels. These can be of various types/forms. Some well-known methods are mentioned here:
  
  - **MERCI Retriever**: This is a sheathed wire that is inserted into the blood vessel. Usually insterd through a completely different area (eg. through groin arteries), it is eventually brought to the blocked vessel. The wire is pushed in from behind and brought in front of the clot. Then sheath is pulled back so that the end of the wire is revealed. The wire itself has a tendency to coil, hence forming a net to catch the clot. The wire is now pulled out and it brings the clot out with it. This method was the first of its kind mechanical procedure to be approved by the FDA.

  - **Aspiration catheter**: This is a suction based method. A tube is inserted into the vessel and brought near the clot. The clot is then poked with a wire while the tube sucks in all the plaque.
  
  **aspiration**
  
  - **Stent retriever**: This wire is used to push the cloth to the periphery of the vessel, allowing blood to flow from the middle and clean up all the pieces.
